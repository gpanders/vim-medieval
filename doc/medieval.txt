						*:EvalBlock* *medieval*

Medieval allows you to evaluate code blocks in Markdown buffers of the
following form:
>
	```bash
	echo "Hello world!"
	```
<
By placing your cursor anywhere in the code block above and running
:EvalBlock, Medieval will print the result of evaluating the block (in this
case, it will echo "Hello world!")

You can also redirect the output of the evaluation into a register using
|:EvalBlock| @{0-9a-z".=*+}.

You can also send the output of evaluation into another code block, allowing
you to do a primitive style of literate programming. You can accomplish this
by adding a "target" parameter to your code block and creating a second code
block with a "name" parameter. The output of the evaluation of your code block
will be redirected to the targeted block. For example:
>
	<!-- target: python -->
	```python
	print([x*x for x in range(5)])
	```

	<!-- name: pypath -->
	```
	```
<
If you run |:EvalBlock| in the first code block, the second block will become
>
	<!-- name: pypath -->
	```
	[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
	```
<
You can also manually specify a target block using |:EvalBlock| {target}. With
[!], |:EvalBlock| will cause the evaluated code block to replace its own
contents with the result of its evaluation:
>
	```sh
	fortune
	```
<
After |:EvalBlock!|:
>
	```sh
	The difference between art and science is that science is what we
	understand well enough to explain to a computer.  Art is everything else.
	                -- Donald Knuth, "Discover"
	```

							*g:medieval_langs*
Medieval will only attempt to execute code blocks in languages explicitly
listed in the variable |g:medieval_langs|. The structure of this variable is a
list of strings corresponding to whitelisted languages that can be
interpreted. If a language's interpreter has a different name than the
language itself, you can use the form "{lang}={interpreter}" to specify what
interpreter should be used.

For example, to allow Medieval to run Python, Ruby, and shell scripts, use
>
	let g:medieval_langs = ['python=python3', 'ruby', 'sh', 'console=bash']
<
By default, |g:medieval_langs| is empty, so you must specify this variable
yourself.
